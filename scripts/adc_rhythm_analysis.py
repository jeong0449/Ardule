"""adc_rhythm_analysis.py 260817c

Shared grace/flam/ghost and straight-16/straight-32/8T/16T subdivision analysis for ADC Toolkit.
Isolated exact-32nd grace→main pairs may be treated as flam ornaments even when velocities are equal; sustained same-family 32nd runs are preserved.
Used by adc-patternlab.py and adc-mid2report.py.

The module analyzes MIDI data only; it does not render output or modify MIDI files.
Legacy adc_flam.py and adc_subdivision.py remain unchanged during migration stage 1.
